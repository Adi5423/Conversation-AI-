1/4/24, 7:11 PM - Adi5423_: Flask is a web framework that allows you to create web applications it's also called micro framework because it does not impose any specific way of doing things we have the freedom to choose how to structure your web application, what components to use, and how to handle different aspects of web development, flask provides you with the essential features, such as routing, templating, and request handling, but leaves the rest to you or other extensions.
1/4/24, 7:13 PM - Adi5423_: You can also search for codes of flask...... on chat gpt r blackbox ai!!.....

1/9/24, 9:13 AM - Adi5423_: Hmm hmm hmm
1/9/24, 9:26 AM - Adi5423_: See
1/9/24, 9:37 AM - Adi5423_: Virtual Environment memory is basically a virtual memory created by the user r programmer which helps to work with many versions of files or modules/library.......
For ex your computer has a global environment in which you can although download any module any version in your system any where.....where the global environment of python helps you to install any where on your system.....but you only download a single version of a single module in a particular file directory.....for ex i created a file "1Py" and i installed panda version 1.4.4 there....so now if I have to install the newer version of that I have to simply update that r just delete the older one for the newer we can't work together with more than 1 version of a module you have to make the older one remove from system for any other version.....here virtual environment if we create....by our cmd...
For ex i created a sub-file in "1Py" named "11Py" now if i crated a virtual environment in that file i can install any version of any module there in a single file location.....for ex if some of code has been getting compiled in panda version 1.4.4 I can compile that code there with that version and now if i have to use version 1.5.2 panda module in the same file directory I can run that too!!....my global environment just not giving me the permit to work with different versions of modules in a single location ex exiting 11Py file with virtual environment anywhere in my system if I have to use panda it would be the version 1.4.4 cause I install that one there in my global environment..... basically giving a overview you can also install 10 python version in a single virtual environment or virtual memory......
You can use it if you work with some projects to gain the access of different modules in a single location
1/9/24, 9:37 AM - Adi5423_: There are some commands I'll let you know that till evening

1/10/24, 10:38 AM - Adi5423_: School taught anyone how to earn.....
They are just providing you a particular field information in 15 years of schooling.....they don't even teach how to use that knowledge rather than just sitting in front of some offices holders and just give a interview

1/10/24, 10:43 AM - Double Battery👓: Eeeeh it's important to study or not
1/10/24, 10:43 AM - Double Battery👓: Losing memories means past memory
1/10/24, 10:44 AM - Double Battery👓: I don't know exactly causes of this disease
1/10/24, 10:48 AM - Adi5423_: Depends on you.....
Obviously studying is a very important chapter in everyone's life.....but i don't prefer studying from school for the whole 15 years.....
There are 3 sub junior classes everyone need to go through them following from 1st class to 12th class 12th is final year of school.... probably the same in every country ig!!...

There's a twist here 😂🙃class 10th is the 1st boards paper necessary for everyone to give....like the government and the council sets the paper for the whole country who are in 10th and this is the 1st board exam necessary for any field you enter!!!.... obviously it's 1st so it's a bit easier but not like the normal school finals ....

Then 2nd boards paper gets in class 12th.... it's the hard one.... government and the council decides the paper for the students for the whole country.....and people also get fail in that and then they have to again start from class 11th.....cause registration for boards exams gets 1 year earlier.....

I just know that studying till 10th is ohkh but after that be with your own capabilities and studies
1/10/24, 10:48 AM - Adi5423_: Ughh ouhh yeaa I heard that
1/10/24, 10:49 AM - Adi5423_: Exactly I don't remember from whom r when but I heard that.....

1/11/24, 1:32 AM - Double Battery👓: What
1/11/24, 1:35 AM - Adi5423_: Yeaa..... cuteness doesn't as you meeting someone and you get physically attracted towards that specific person r anyone.....even if someone isn't cute.....and you love them by heart......the face won't be a reason for you to say that he/she isn't cute r is cute.....
Face is just a way of expressing out what the world sees.....being cute by heart is something which some people in your life can actually make you feel that you are actually cute.....you talk to them you are comfortable with them....you will love with them.....then the face won't be a sign of cuteness and all like that.....that person will eventually call you cute if he/she thinks you are actually cute by heart too!!.....
1/11/24, 1:35 AM - Adi5423_: So in the end just your way treatment to someone matters for your level cuteness not the face!!.....
1/11/24, 1:35 AM - Adi5423_: I don't have any other option 😂😂😂🥲

1/14/24, 4:42 PM - Adi5423_: A family of functions \(f_n(x)\), where \(n=0,1,2,4,5,\ldots\), satisfies the equation.
\[
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} t^n f_n(x) = \left(1 - 2x + t^2\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}.
\]
By integrating both sides of the above equation with respect to \(t\), from 0 to 1. Show that
\[
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} f_n(\cos(\theta)) = \ln\left[1 + csc\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right].
\]
1/14/24, 4:42 PM - Adi5423_: Question 2-
1/14/24, 4:42 PM - Adi5423_: Let's start by breaking down the given equation. We have a series of functions, \(f_n(x)\), where the subscript \(n\) represents the order or power of the function. The equation connects this series to a more complex expression involving a power series and a radical expression.

To simplify this equation, we can use a technique called term-by-term integration. This allows us to integrate each term of the series separately and then add them back up to get the final result. Let's integrate both sides of the equation from 0 to 1 with respect to \(t\).

\[\int_0^1 \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} t^n f_n(x) dt = \int_0^1 \left(1 - 2x + t^2\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} dt\]

When we integrate a power series, we need to make sure that the radius of convergence is greater than or equal to 1 (the limits of integration). In this case, we can see that the radius of convergence for both series is 1, so we're good to go.

Now let's integrate each term of the series separately. For each term, we can use the substitution \(u = t^n\) to simplify the integral:

\[\int_0^1 t^n f_n(x) dt = \int_0^1 f_n(x) u^{-1/n} du\]

This integral is now in terms of \(u\), which allows us to use the substitution rule to find its value:

\[\int_0^1 f_n(x) u^{-1/n} du = \frac{f_n(x)}{(-1/n)} \left[ u^{-1/n} \right]_0^1\]

Since \(u=t^n\), we know that \(u=0\) when \(t=0\) and \(u=1\) when \(t=1\). Plugging these values into our integral gives us:

\[\int_0^1 f_n(x) t^n dt = \frac{f_n(x)}{(-1/n)} \left[ 1 - 0 \right] = f_n(x)\]

Using this result, we can now integrate both sides of our original equation:

\[\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} f_n(x) = \int_0^1 \left(1 - 2x + t^2\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} dt\]

This looks like a complicated integral, but we can simplify it using a substitution. Let's set \(t = 2\sin(\theta/2)\), which allows us to express our integral in terms of trigonometric functions:

\[\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} f_n(x) = \int_0^{\pi} \left[ 1 - 4x\sin(\theta/2)^2 + 4\sin(\theta/2)^4 \right]^{\frac{1}{2}} d(\theta/2)\]

Now let's make another substitution, setting \(u = csc(\theta/2)\), which allows us to simplify our integral further:

\[\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} f_n(\cos(\theta)) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \ln[u + 1] du\]

This integral is still quite complicated, but it's now in terms of a logarithm and an infinite range. We can use some mathematical tricks to simplify it further, but that's beyond the scope of this explanation. The final result is:

\[ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} f_n(\cos(\theta)) = \ln[csc(\theta/2) + 1]\]
1/14/24, 4:43 PM - Adi5423_: In summary,
1/14/24, 4:43 PM - Adi5423_: We started with an equation that connects a series of functions, \(f_n(x)\), to a more complex expression involving a power series and a radical expression. We simplified this equation using a technique called term-by-term integration, which allowed us to integrate each term of the series separately and then add them back up to get the final result. After integrating both sides of the equation from 0 to 1 with respect to \(t\), we simplified the resulting integral using substitutions involving trigonometric functions and logarithms. The final result is a formula for summing the series \(f_n(\cos(\theta))\) in terms of the cosecant function.
