5/25/24, 4:53 PM - Whookid Africa: What's up bro
5/25/24, 4:54 PM - Whookid Africa: Can you give ideas for game development for a beginner
5/25/24, 4:54 PM - Whookid Africa: And what kind of games do u create
5/25/24, 8:41 PM - Adi5423_: Ideas you must think onè by your own....ideas take time to be come in mind and get implemented
5/25/24, 8:42 PM - Adi5423_: I m not that much into it but i just created 2 games for getting hands on
5/25/24, 11:15 PM - Whookid Africa: I mean I have some ideas but I don't know some like things that can make this even easier I imean tools
5/25/24, 11:15 PM - Whookid Africa: Do you know any
5/25/24, 11:16 PM - Whookid Africa: What language do you code them in
5/25/24, 11:16 PM - Whookid Africa: 2D
5/25/24, 11:34 PM - Adi5423_: Not now
5/25/24, 11:35 PM - Adi5423_: Use unity it's free and best
5/25/24, 11:35 PM - Adi5423_: You can make what you want easily ther....
5/25/24, 11:35 PM - Adi5423_: there*
5/25/24, 11:35 PM - Adi5423_: 3d
5/25/24, 11:35 PM - Adi5423_: One for android other for Windows
5/25/24, 11:36 PM - Adi5423_: Unity Game Dev Engine just supports C#
5/25/24, 11:36 PM - Adi5423_: So yeah i code them in C#
5/25/24, 11:36 PM - Whookid Africa: What about python
5/25/24, 11:36 PM - Whookid Africa: Okay thanks
5/25/24, 11:37 PM - Adi5423_: Not good for game dev , can create games with python but not that much good
5/25/24, 11:37 PM - Whookid Africa: It take me a decade to learn c#
5/25/24, 11:37 PM - Adi5423_: Better you go with game development engines
5/25/24, 11:37 PM - Adi5423_: Start learning a easy language in programming like python later switch to a hard one
5/25/24, 11:37 PM - Whookid Africa: Damn okay so there ain't no other option
5/25/24, 11:38 PM - Adi5423_: I don't know the whole C# not even perfect basics , i just know python and a bit more java
5/25/24, 11:38 PM - Adi5423_: I did ml in python
5/25/24, 11:38 PM - Adi5423_: So i easily switched to C#
5/25/24, 11:38 PM - Whookid Africa: I now know python so I can now switch to c#
5/25/24, 11:38 PM - Whookid Africa: In University
5/25/24, 11:38 PM - Adi5423_: There are options but better if you go with what the tools are available for what task
5/25/24, 11:39 PM - Adi5423_: What are your projects?
5/25/24, 11:39 PM - Whookid Africa: But u can create a game
5/25/24, 11:39 PM - Adi5423_: By own
5/25/24, 11:39 PM - Adi5423_: By yt and AI
5/25/24, 11:39 PM - Whookid Africa: And u know ml I don even know where to start
5/25/24, 11:40 PM - Adi5423_: I can....
Use the technologies , like go with BlackBox ai and Chat GPT and Gemini for code tutorial....i did the same i didn't purchased a course even till now
5/25/24, 11:40 PM - Whookid Africa: A space invaders game
5/25/24, 11:40 PM - Whookid Africa: And now I'm working on a platformer 2D in pygame
5/25/24, 11:41 PM - Whookid Africa: And this blackbox I hear it a lot is it free
5/25/24, 11:41 PM - Adi5423_: Just stood with the things your interest attracts to....for ex my attraction towards AI and Automation so i did this and all for myself
5/25/24, 11:41 PM - Adi5423_: Umm ohkh
5/25/24, 11:41 PM - Whookid Africa: 😂😂😂 learning made easier for those who are interested
5/25/24, 11:42 PM - Adi5423_: If u want to persuate with game dev then why you doing python
5/25/24, 11:42 PM - Adi5423_: Go with c
5/25/24, 11:42 PM - Adi5423_: And use game dev engines rather learning a library and sticking with a single language
5/25/24, 11:42 PM - Adi5423_: For real.......
5/25/24, 11:43 PM - Adi5423_: You just need to know what you have to learn nothing else
5/25/24, 11:43 PM - Adi5423_: Everything's free nowdays
5/25/24, 11:43 PM - Adi5423_: Wait lee mee send my game apk
5/25/24, 11:43 PM - Whookid Africa: Ohh okay so python is just good at ai and automation
5/25/24, 11:43 PM - Whookid Africa: And for game Dev...
5/25/24, 11:44 PM - Whookid Africa: C# okay I'll get started on that
5/25/24, 11:44 PM - Adi5423_: "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1t4Ss5ZO_11ZmycsoCsSu_Akh_EpRdryz?usp=drive_link"

You can see the first test apk and then the final test apk with the name "With Sound - 3"
5/25/24, 11:44 PM - Adi5423_: it runs only in android
5/25/24, 11:44 PM - Adi5423_: Yeahhh
5/25/24, 11:45 PM - Adi5423_: Yeah if u really wanna get into game dev learn the C# and then learn Unity Game Engine
5/25/24, 11:45 PM - Adi5423_: If you just wanna make some games
5/25/24, 11:45 PM - Adi5423_: For getting hands on like me
5/25/24, 11:45 PM - Whookid Africa: Okay
5/25/24, 11:46 PM - Whookid Africa: Yeah I have that so it's 3d I bet you did maths 😂😂
5/25/24, 11:46 PM - Adi5423_: Just Start with Unity directly and basics of C# and later u will learn C# as well properly with time and more projects.....
5/25/24, 11:46 PM - Adi5423_: Ugh huuhh 😂
5/25/24, 11:46 PM - Whookid Africa: I like it for fun it's just fun maybe it myt get serious
5/25/24, 11:46 PM - Whookid Africa: 👍🏼
5/25/24, 11:47 PM - Whookid Africa: So unity game engine has to be learnt too🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🥵
5/25/24, 11:47 PM - Adi5423_: I was now days working on Space game but didn't got any free 3D model of Sun for my project so currently dropped the idea and working on Automation project with C#
5/25/24, 11:47 PM - Adi5423_: It's shitttt , it's just so wide , don't think it's fun
5/25/24, 11:47 PM - Whookid Africa: Does it involve a lot of mathematics
5/25/24, 11:48 PM - Adi5423_: You will get errors which you not gonna find the solutions online so better to make a mindset to stick with problems
5/25/24, 11:48 PM - Adi5423_: Yeaahh
5/25/24, 11:48 PM - Adi5423_: Without that you can't
5/25/24, 11:48 PM - Adi5423_: Depends on your game
5/25/24, 11:48 PM - Adi5423_: But yeah maths
5/25/24, 11:48 PM - Whookid Africa: What's automation all about I don't really get the idea
5/25/24, 11:49 PM - Adi5423_: Is important but no need to worry
5/25/24, 11:49 PM - Whookid Africa: It's not fun😂😂
5/25/24, 11:49 PM - Adi5423_: You will learn that much with time and tutorials and experience
5/25/24, 11:49 PM - Whookid Africa: Yah it's really a drag
5/25/24, 11:50 PM - Whookid Africa: Yeah there is no way around it
5/25/24, 11:50 PM - Adi5423_: Making things automatic with ML and Artificial Intelligence
5/25/24, 11:50 PM - Adi5423_: Nahhhhh
5/25/24, 11:51 PM - Whookid Africa: Okay that's the thing to do nowadays for the future
5/25/24, 11:51 PM - Adi5423_: That's not like that
5/25/24, 11:51 PM - Adi5423_: I m not a specialist r a topper in maths
5/25/24, 11:51 PM - Adi5423_: R something else
5/25/24, 11:51 PM - Adi5423_: I just know i have to learn coding and make my projects to come real
5/25/24, 11:51 PM - Adi5423_: I can learn anything then
5/25/24, 11:52 PM - Adi5423_: Doesn't matter it's maths r physics
5/25/24, 11:52 PM - Adi5423_: Game incl both Physics and Maths
5/25/24, 11:52 PM - Whookid Africa: Okay so like do you have projects In ml like the automation
5/25/24, 11:52 PM - Adi5423_: If you will just keep learning nothing gonna happen until and unless u step up to work on your ideas
5/25/24, 11:52 PM - Adi5423_: I do
5/25/24, 11:53 PM - Whookid Africa: Yeah those to things fail to know them and implement them properly your game will suck
5/25/24, 11:54 PM - Whookid Africa: That's a fact but sometimes these PDFs don't offer much
5/25/24, 11:54 PM - Adi5423_: Yeah Mathematics and Physics is so wide don't just stick a particular thing start implementing
5/25/24, 11:54 PM - Whookid Africa: Yah u have really come a long way for hw long have u been coding
5/25/24, 11:55 PM - Adi5423_: Don't go with others notes make your own from your own style , you can't learn properly from others notes
5/25/24, 11:56 PM - Adi5423_: They are just a piece of information but you can create what u learning by videos create your own notes
5/25/24, 11:56 PM - Adi5423_: That gonna be best fr
5/25/24, 11:56 PM - Whookid Africa: Especially 3D , becoz these 2Ds are giving me trouble and without an engine we ain't going nowhere
5/25/24, 11:56 PM - Adi5423_: Ugh i think 1 Year
5/25/24, 11:57 PM - Whookid Africa: 🥵😂😂😂What
5/25/24, 11:57 PM - Adi5423_: Hmmm , you will also have to learn a lot , like 3D Modelling , Sculpting , Texturing , Graphics , and etc ,
5/25/24, 11:57 PM - Adi5423_: I also do 3D Modeling
5/25/24, 11:57 PM - Whookid Africa: That's one fuck*ng lie
5/25/24, 11:57 PM - Adi5423_: I make Animated Phots , and short videos......
5/25/24, 11:57 PM - Adi5423_: Yeaahh 😂
5/25/24, 11:58 PM - Adi5423_: Ugh naah naah that isn't 😂
5/25/24, 11:58 PM - Whookid Africa: Yeah thts really wat we begginers miss proper media and then we get stuck
5/25/24, 11:58 PM - Adi5423_: It just been a year
5/25/24, 11:58 PM - Adi5423_: Yeahh just watch tutorial use Ai and make your own notes
5/25/24, 11:59 PM - Whookid Africa: Bro how old are you thts a lot do u have like a bachelor in these things
5/25/24, 11:59 PM - Adi5423_: It was just a random night when i started learning python 😂
5/25/24, 11:59 PM - Adi5423_: To just do timepass then i started living in it 🥹
5/25/24, 11:59 PM - Whookid Africa: Umm how do you do man what's the trick
5/25/24, 11:59 PM - Adi5423_: I m 17 now....
5/26/24, 12:00 AM - Whookid Africa: Umm thts deep it can't be achieved in one year😂
5/26/24, 12:00 AM - Adi5423_: Thankyouu for the appreciation.....🥹
5/26/24, 12:01 AM - Whookid Africa: 😳 Yeah some are called to it🥵
5/26/24, 12:01 AM - Whookid Africa: Yeah python is fun but if you get too comfortable you myt go dumb 😂😂
5/26/24, 12:02 AM - Whookid Africa: But man u serious aren't you like 20 or something 😅
5/26/24, 12:02 AM - Adi5423_: I just used AI and youtube together.....and started making projects even when i was just a learner now too i m learner but still , i started making projects , when i just cleared the basics of python , i thought that's enough in python 😂although i was wrong but those projects helped me learn a lot
5/26/24, 12:03 AM - Adi5423_: It can 😂only if you be mad for what you wanna do 🙃
5/26/24, 12:03 AM - Adi5423_: Ugh huhhh 🥹😂

5/26/24, 12:05 AM - Adi5423_: Mee was also so dumb in programming in starting , i got to know about java i learned java from a coaching institute that person made me learn java basics and a bit intermediate....then i got to know what the heck is this coaching , leaving java i switched to python , and now switching to C# for projects implementation.....
5/26/24, 12:05 AM - Whookid Africa: Okay I think you motivation is permanent cause we others we just say umm nahh I'll learn some more after maybe a week 😂😂😂😂
5/26/24, 12:05 AM - Adi5423_: Nah nah i m not 😂😂 i just got 17 on 1st May this year 😂
5/26/24, 12:06 AM - Adi5423_: Heheheheh 🥹coding is just loveee uk.....🫀💫🥹
5/26/24, 12:06 AM - Whookid Africa: Okay thats a huge leap bro u've got talent and determination if one could only copy🥵👍🏼
5/26/24, 12:06 AM - Adi5423_: Ugh i don't think soo....even i too sometimes think am i doing i something i m not supposed too.....
5/26/24, 12:06 AM - Adi5423_: Then i try to switch into different things and all
5/26/24, 12:07 AM - Adi5423_: Then back to coding like a fcker 😂😂
5/26/24, 12:07 AM - Whookid Africa: U are going to kill people with depression 😂😂😂
5/26/24, 12:07 AM - Adi5423_: Anything for coding 🥹

5/26/24, 12:13 AM - Adi5423_: How long it been to you
5/26/24, 12:13 AM - Adi5423_: In coding
5/26/24, 12:13 AM - Whookid Africa: Okay me I just started like January
5/26/24, 12:14 AM - Whookid Africa: Let's say 3 months of procrastination 😂😂
5/26/24, 12:14 AM - Adi5423_: Umm hmm any specific reason to dive in coding sector
5/26/24, 12:14 AM - Whookid Africa: And Im looking for ways to really get hands on with everything
5/26/24, 12:15 AM - Adi5423_: Ugh yeaa yeaaa 😂3 months also a lot time🌟
5/26/24, 12:15 AM - Whookid Africa: I just like the stuff and I think too much but less action 😂
5/26/24, 12:15 AM - Adi5423_: Just start after learning even a bit , cause all this is like na just soo wide.....just start making things when u learn even a small things
5/26/24, 12:16 AM - Adi5423_: Just make atleast worst but make
5/26/24, 12:16 AM - Whookid Africa: So I'm trying to get into kivy now but it's telling me go and perfect your classes tutorials😂😂

5/26/24, 12:17 AM - Whookid Africa: Umm bro to a slow moving development it's not😂
5/26/24, 12:17 AM - Adi5423_: Uk like just now before chatting with you i was trying to integrate the Speech Recognition in C# damm it's soo hectic in C for beginners🫠
5/26/24, 12:18 AM - Whookid Africa: Okay thanks for the tip cause sometimes I try to make the projects too perfect and I get stuck and drop
5/26/24, 12:18 AM - Adi5423_: Should i suggest you something?.....
5/26/24, 12:18 AM - Adi5423_: Everyone start with this so no worries just chill 😂
5/26/24, 12:18 AM - Whookid Africa: But u do it less of the times 😂😂
5/26/24, 12:19 AM - Whookid Africa: Yeah yeah go on
5/26/24, 12:19 AM - Whookid Africa: But how's c's SYNTAX 😂😂I see a lot of memes on pipo who switch having troubles
5/26/24, 12:19 AM - Adi5423_: i too , i have a lot of dropped projects uk......
But let it be everyone has do nothing gonna be perfect unless and until u bee a professional and like that something......
Just try to make atleast.....that's the main nothing else
5/26/24, 12:20 AM - Adi5423_: Ughhh you spying mee 😂😂😂😂
5/26/24, 12:20 AM - Whookid Africa: Okay will but now that I have a challenge but not that I can beat I will push this thing
5/26/24, 12:20 AM - Adi5423_: What your main goal like , a game developer , software engineer , Ai , like what you wanna get into with coding....
5/26/24, 12:21 AM - Adi5423_: Like me in Automation and AI
5/26/24, 12:21 AM - Adi5423_: SO what bout you
5/26/24, 12:21 AM - Adi5423_: It's shittt mannnnnn 😂fr shittttt🫠
5/26/24, 12:22 AM - Adi5423_: Even uk why i m switching to C# , i just want to make a AI Application with Unity Engine , and it just supports C# so yeah that why
5/26/24, 12:22 AM - Whookid Africa: Okay but in making lies the knowing you know soo I have to go deeper in this intermidiate then I have a foundation
5/26/24, 12:22 AM - Whookid Africa: 😂😂😂waht why how <This message was edited>
5/26/24, 12:23 AM - Adi5423_: Try to find the solution of the problems and errors.....learn why the error r that problem is and analyze what you doing u automatically gonna get the solution by own so don't drop
5/26/24, 12:23 AM - Whookid Africa: Ai but just beating around the bush to have fun😂😂
5/26/24, 12:23 AM - Whookid Africa: Haa I don't think I'll be landing on that side anytime soon
5/26/24, 12:24 AM - Adi5423_: Start slow , i was just a mad , got back on the track cause of luck r extra work idk but just start slow buddy , if u dont then u gonna get a lot issues later.....
5/26/24, 12:24 AM - Adi5423_: Start slow
5/26/24, 12:24 AM - Adi5423_: and learn first
5/26/24, 12:24 AM - Adi5423_: Atleast the foundation
5/26/24, 12:24 AM - Whookid Africa: Okay so when it comes to implementing C# comes into picture
5/26/24, 12:24 AM - Adi5423_: I don't know anything i m just a learner
5/26/24, 12:25 AM - Whookid Africa: Noted that another problem solved 😂😂
5/26/24, 12:26 AM - Whookid Africa: Yeah coz we want to jump into the fun stuff too early
5/26/24, 12:26 AM - Adi5423_: Hahahahaha😂
5/26/24, 12:26 AM - Whookid Africa: Okay so the goal is just to keep learning 👍🏼
5/26/24, 12:26 AM - Adi5423_: That's why i started doing that , idk but i love Automations and AI
5/26/24, 12:27 AM - Adi5423_: I never thought the same for mee too but see i m doing
5/26/24, 12:27 AM - Whookid Africa: This has helped me a lot now I have somewhere to start again thanks man
5/26/24, 12:27 AM - Adi5423_: I was really the lowest marks student in my class
5/26/24, 12:27 AM - Adi5423_: And in Computer Science i was really shit
5/26/24, 12:28 AM - Adi5423_: Ugh i don't know much bout C# , i m trying to make a final application with C# atleast till 1st of June to publish my first application on PlayStore
5/26/24, 12:28 AM - Whookid Africa: Me too but for robotics if get the sense I figured that maybe I can do electronics along with coding
